        <h2>LuJong</h2>

        <div class="technique-description float-left">
            <h3>Tibetan healing yoga</h3>
            <p>
                LuJong is a BodyMind training with origins in the Tibetan Buddhist Tantrayana school and the BÃ¶n tradition.
                Based on the knowledge of Traditional Tibetan Medicine (TTM), this healing yoga activates the regenerative
                powers and stabilizes the balance of body, mind and breath. With concentrative breathing, the simple,
                flowing, gentle movements work very deeply into your body and mind and can change your life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lu (Tibetan: body) Jong (exercises) are meditative practice sequences. They promote mindfulness and concentration.
                In their basic structure, they are easy to learn and suitable for all age groups.

        <h2>TsaLung</h2>

        <div class="technique-description float-left">
            <h3>Activate healing energies</h3>
            <p>
                TsaLung is a more demanding BodyMind training that uses dynamic physical exercises, visualizations
                and concentrated breathing control to make deep-seated inner patterns recognizable and help transform them.
                For millennia, the techniques were developed and practiced by Tibetan Buddhist monks. Through continuous
                practice, this training with the energy currents can also be used for the transmission of healing energy via the hands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tsa (Tibetan: body channels) Lung (flow of energy, breath) is a powerful, deep practice with great healing potential.
            </p>
            <h3>Long-term benefits of TsaLung:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    balances body fluids (eg hormones, lymph fluid, digestive juices, blood) by removing waste materials and helping
                    to transport valuable substances (eg oxygen) to the most remote cells
                </li>
                <li>
                    is able to control internal processes through conscious deep breathing, which otherwise usually take place
                    unconsciously, such as reactions to stress, blood pressure, hormone release, processes in the para- and sympathetic
                    nervous system
                </li>
                <li>
                    changes the states of consciousness depending on the selected breathing pattern (breathing rhythm, speed, depth,
                    direction and density), calms circles of thought, frees from disturbing emotions and thereby also relaxes the body
                </li>
                <li>
                    Breathing techniques and imagination are able to sustainably influence the effects of stress on body and mind and
                    to reverse them to a large extent
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mindfulness of breath brings a deeper self-image, serenity, joie de vivre and trust in your own life force
                </li>
                <li>
                    activates the self-healing and resistance forces and accelerates healing processes
                </li>
                <li>
                    improves mental strength, clarity, concentration and mental calm
                </li>
                <li>
                    accelerates subtle spiritual knowledge and development processes
                </li>
            </ul>
