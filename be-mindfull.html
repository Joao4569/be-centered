        <h1>Meditation</h1>
        <div class="technique-description float-left">
            <h2>Awareness</h2>
            <p>
                Meditation is a central tool in BodyMind training. Meditation enables us to discover and cultivate our own silence,
                boundless space and radiance, beyond thoughts and emotions. This inner source is the place of all-one being,
                the origin of being healthy and of ethical action. The meditation techniques chosen in each case serve as an aid to
                practice a state of consciousness in which clear, wide-awake awareness and relaxation are possible at the same time
                and with less effort - in formal practice as well as in everyday life (applied meditation).
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically all meditations are based on two techniques, on Shin√© / Shamata (a lingering-concentrated,
                flexible-focused and perceptual state) and on Vipassana (the panoramic, non-conceptual awareness).
                Together they ultimately reveal the non-material, flowing, knowing primary consciousness (enlightenment).
            </p>
            <h2>Long-term benefits of healing meditation:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    teaches you to consciously direct your perception to the present moment and to approach what you perceive
                    with the most accepting attitude possible
                </li>
                <li>
                    cultivates ubiquitous mindfulness for every moment in our lives; through this we notice what makes us
                    un- / happy, what is un- / healthy
                </li>
                <li>
                    shows us how we can think constructively about, for example, our own experiences, self-inflicted suffering,
                    evaluations, ideas
                </li>
                <li>
                    has a healing effect on the conceptual, discursive mind, shows us how we can direct thoughts and emotions in
                    order to guide us self-consciously and lovingly through life's challenges
                </li>
                <li>
                    helps to get out of circling thoughts and emotions and to relax in pleasant sensations in the inner space and
                    to recognize oneself as a source of meaning in one's own life
                </li>
                <li>
                    fills life with integrity, meaningfulness, contentment, self-love, self-confidence
                </li>
                <li>
                    increases self-efficacy, resilience (psychological resilience in crises), creativity, mental clarity
                </li>
                <li>
                    improves inner balance, compassion, humanity, the feeling of connectedness in interdependence
                </li>
                <li>
                    lets us see that everything is fleeting and changeable and that every effect is based on a cause

        <h1>Mind Balancing</h1>
        <div class="technique-description float-left">
            <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
            <p>
                Mind balancing is a BodyMind training that localizes and transforms embodied emotional patterns such as uncontrollable anger attacks,
                stuck grief or recurring fears through targeted movement sequences. By means of mental training / thought training and meditations,
                healthier psychological and spiritual patterns are practiced. Mind balancing is based on the knowledge of Buddhist psychology and philosophy,
                traditional Tibetan medicine and modern brain research. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Mind balancing teaches how the mind works. We learn to control it, train it and promote its perceptual abilities.
                This makes us happy more unconditionally and permanently, we think more positively and thus generate more self-confidence
                 and zest for life from ourselves.
            </p>
            <h2>Long-term benefits of mind balancing:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    compensates for psychological imbalances
                </li>
                <li>
                    makes us aware of our discursive, self-destructive thoughts, emotions and the associated body sensations and breathing patterns.
                    In this way we can influence them positively and deal with them constructively
                </li>
                <li>
                    trains our inner observer, who succeeds in taking mental breaks from broadcasting and expanding the self-forgotten flow moments and meditative,
                    non-conceptual states of awareness
                </li>
                <li>
                    trains positive perception and the meaningful, goal-oriented nature of thoughts, because happiness in life depends on it
                </li>
                <li>
                    teaches positive, healthier tools through which we develop strengths of character such as devotion, openness, nonduality, compassion,
                    serenity, joy of being and balance
                </li>
